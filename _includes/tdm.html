				<h1>Enabling TDM</h1>
				<p class="info">In collaboration with our UW Library staff team members, xDD negotiates agreements with publishers that allow programatic downloading and mining of published content.</p>

				<p class="info">All documents are securely stored on an access-controlled server at the heart of our digital library infrastructure (xDD team members and our collaborators do not have access to original content via our infrastructure). UW-Madison's <a href="http://chtc.cs.wisc.edu">Center for High Throughput Computing</a> supplies the computational power for processing documents using NLP, OCR, and other software tools useful for TDM tasks, which also allows for deploying new tools quickly against all existing documents.</p>
